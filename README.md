# Your click matters

This is a web page built in Flask that has 4 color boxes in the main page, each one with a word randomly chosen in each refresh from a determined set of words. Each click that you make in a box is sent to the server and the color and word of the click are saved in the database. There is another page in the web which has the statistics regarding to the total amount of clicks made in the page, by color and by word. You can alos see in this page the total proportions that each color represents in the total amount of clicks, same to words.

The Jinja template for the main page is `inicio.html` and the one for the stats page is `stats.html`.
